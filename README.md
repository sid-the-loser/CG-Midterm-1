# CG-Midterm-1

This was a Unity Project made for the practical portion of the midterm conducted in (09-Oct-2024).

# Where are all the explanations? 

All of the explanations can be found in the shader files themselves. Easy to look through since I only made one shader and it does both **color grading** and **toon shading**.

# Wheres the build?

Build is in the releases section!

# Have a nice day!
